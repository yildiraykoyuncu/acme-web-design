# Incremental Development Case Study

## Usage

This website is created to learn how to work with branches and follow the workflow described in development strategy.

You can check out the [development strategy file](./development-strategy.md) and [network graph](https://github.com/yildiraykoyuncu/semantic-layout-exercise/network) under the insights tab to see how this project has been built step by step.

Do not pay much attention on styling since a good looking site is not the final goal.
